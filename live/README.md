# Directory contents

This directory contains the changes that are required to make Agama Live to
work with the HTTP-based version of Agama. In the future, it should contains all
the files.

## Skipping the authentication

In order to skip the authentication, we decided to inject a valid authentication
token in the browser. This token is autogenerated by the `agama-web-server serve`
command (using the `--generate-token` option).

Then, the Firefox start-up script (`startup`) takes care of injecting such a token
in the cookies database (`/root/.mozilla/firefox/profile/cookies.sqlite`).
